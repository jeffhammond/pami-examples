This code is designed to demonstrate how to use PAMI.

On Blue Gene/Q systems, all of the examples should build trivially with "make -j16" in each subdirectory.

Please direct all criticism at Jeff Hammond (jhammond@alcf.anl.gov).

Consider signing up for the PAMI discussion list at http://lists.alcf.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/pami-discuss.

Best,
